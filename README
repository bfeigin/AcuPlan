COMMON USAGE:

Things to consider:
- Removing the -v option for any of the below examples results in only 
  the leaf data being printed. This is usefull when trying to pipe 
  the output to an external command.
- Passing a username/password is only required if the acunote.session file
  has not been created. It will be created automatically upon successfull login.
  The saved session improves performance by eliminating unnecessary log ins 
  but passing your credentials every time guarantees that the session can be
  renewed if it's stale.
- Only present sprints will be traversed for each project.

First time usage. Print all the issues in a sprint, along with issue name, owner, etc.
./af -U user -P pass -vs 23698

Print all the CLs for a specific issue, along with their descriptions, etc.
./af -vi 169835

Print all the (present) sprints in a project, along with sprint names, etc.
./af -vp 5223

Print the number of the Dev and QA Sprints for this week
./af -vp 5223 -f "sprint_description:/Dev/QA/"

Print only the issues owned by askryl for a specific sprint.
./af -vs 23698 -f "issue_owner:/askryl/"

Print only the issues owned by askryl and srabiela and whose description 
contains 'customer' for each sprint provided.
./af -vs 23698,23681 -f "issue_owner:/askryl/srabiela/,issue_description:/address/"

Print all the unique files touched by any CL in the two issues specified.
./af -i 169439,169835 -ur2

Integrate all the files in all the CLs (non integration CLs) for a specific issue. 
Note that all file paths are returned with the depot name prepended. colrm can be used
to trim the output to a convenient character position. 
./af -i 186735 -r2 -uf "change_list_description:no_integrates" | colrm 1 30 | args -I$ p4 integrate branch1/$ branch2/$

Prints every issue in a sprint, the Cls for each issue, and the files 
touched by each CL. This data tree is also dumped to a yaml file. 
./af -vs 23698 -r3 -d "sprint23698.yml"



**DON'T DO THIS**
